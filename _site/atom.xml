      <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. “What’s happened to me? “ he thought. It wasn’t a dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Conceptualising is hard because it requires to shut down our graphic imagination and stay focused on the big picture. Principles and data over layout and typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.&lt;/p&gt;
